C++ Algorithms and Practice Tasks

A collection of small C++ programs covering arrays, matrices, and basic algorithmic problems. These tasks were created for practice and problem-solving exercises.

arrays/ → Tasks related to 1D arrays

matrices/ → Tasks involving 2D arrays and matrix operations

sorting/ → Sorting and searching algorithms

strings/ → String manipulation and text-based problems

📝 Implemented Tasks
Arrays

middle_elements.cpp → Generates a random array of odd length and extracts the three middle elements (center + neighbors).

Matrices

max_element_replace.cpp → Generates a 2D matrix, finds the maximum element, and replaces all its occurrences with 0.

(More tasks will be added gradually.)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-algorithms-and-tasks.git
cd cpp-algorithms-and-tasks


Compile a program using g++:

g++ arrays/middle_elements.cpp -o middle_elements
./middle_elements

📌 Notes

These programs were written for practice and educational purposes.

Each file is self-contained and can be compiled/run independently.
