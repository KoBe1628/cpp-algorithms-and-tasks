📝 Implemented Tasks
Arrays

middle_elements.cpp → Generates a random odd-length array and extracts the three middle elements (center and neighbors).

replace_next_if_multiple_of_10.cpp → Replaces the next element with the current one if the current is divisible by 10 and the next is not.

Matrices

max_element_replace.cpp → Generates a matrix of random numbers, finds the maximum element, and replaces all occurrences of it with 0.

Math

right_triangle_perimeter.cpp → Given two legs of a right triangle, calculates the hypotenuse and the perimeter.

Strings

case_insensitive_compare.cpp → Compares two strings in a case-insensitive way and prints whether they are equal.

concatenate_without_first.cpp → Removes the first character from two strings and concatenates the remaining parts.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-algorithms-and-tasks.git
cd cpp-algorithms-and-tasks


Navigate to a folder (e.g., arrays):

cd arrays


Compile a program using g++:

g++ middle_elements.cpp -o middle_elements
./middle_elements

📌 Notes

Each program is self-contained and can be compiled/run independently.

These are practice tasks, showcasing C++ fundamentals in arrays, matrices, math, and string manipulation.
